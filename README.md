## What I learned
1. Setting up and Using Azure Application insights within a Javascript app
2. React fundamentals; creating components, setting state, passing data into components, etc...
3. Using Bing Maps API to display maps in a web client. Bing maps, unlike Google Maps, allows you to use it behind an auth wall. Thank you Microsoft for that allowing that and thanks to iniamudhan for the React BingMaps component library (https://github.com/iniamudhan/react-bingmaps)

## Previous skills I was able to practice
JavaScript, which I'd gotten a little rusty in since most of my web work is in TypeScript
Architectural design and implementation of a Server/Client system using a lot of different tech, which are listed below:
