A React app that serves as the client for the API available here: https://github.com/nel-sam/CarpulApi
This app is essentially a match-making app for carpools users.

## What I learned

1. Setting up and Using Azure Application insights within a Javascript app
2. React fundamentals; creating components, setting state, passing data into components, etc...
3. Using Bing Maps API to display maps in a web client. Bing maps, unlike Google Maps, allows you to use it behind an auth wall. Thank you Microsoft for that allowing that and thanks to iniamudhan for the React BingMaps component library (https://github.com/iniamudhan/react-bingmaps)

## Previous skills I was able to practice

1. JavaScript, which I'd gotten a little rusty in since most of my web work is in TypeScript
2. Architectural design and implementation of a Server/Client system using a lot of different tech, which are listed below:
